## Skype + Screen sharing

All modern companies use some kind of online meeting/screen sharing technology. It is used to connect to a meeting or for demonstrating something to remote employees between different offices or someone working from home. Each company has it'spreferred application for this. Ex : Citrix, Skype,  BlueJeans etc. It is good tobe familiar with at least one of these so that we are ready when we need it. Alsomore and more interviews are  being done online now and screen sharing is used extensively.

**What we want to achieve**

You should be able to quick connect with someone else and share your screen. 

## Virtual machhines and Vagrant

Virtual machines allow us to run an OS inside a Host OS. 
For example we can run an instance of Ubuntu (Linux) inside of Windows.
We will use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run virtual machines. 

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a commandline tool we use to manage VirtualBoxes.
 
## Linux Console

Basic knowledge of Unix shell programming is essential. We will follow the free course 
from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595) to get upto speed with Unix/Linux Shell.

After that to gain more experience work through [Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames)

## Git, Github

All software written is kept in some version control repository. Git is the preferred choice for that. Github is where most of the popular open source projects are hosted.

Learning Git and Github is an ongoing process and as you work with it more and more, you will learn more about it. But the aim is to b e able to do the following.

**What we want to achieve**

  * Install git on local machine
  * Be able to use git from command line
  * Be able to use git as shown here [A Beginner's Git and GitHub Tutorial](https://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html)
  * Be able to clone a project from github
  * Be able to send pull requests to Github
  * Be able to merge and rebase code

Some of the above will sound complicated. But we will go step by step, until it sinks in.
